Today we covered softwares including AWS, Unix/Linux Command, GitHub, Shell, Vim, and Python.

AWS is a strong tool that we can use Amazon's storage and server to do projects that require hard and complicated computation. We learnt how to set up AWS account and launch an EC2 instance. 

Unix/Linux Command is a primal language that we use in the terminal to perform manipulation towards files like writing txt or python files and running them. We have to understand Unix/Linux Command because it is critical and if we want to start doing projects, we cannot avoid using this language. 

We also learnt how to use GitHub, which is a powerful tool that we can be able to share codes when we are involved in a group project. Git can save the history of files we modified each time by using repository. So when doing a group project, people don't have to save multiple nearly identical files. 

Shell is a language that we can use it to manipulate commands like running them for many times. It is a media that we use to communicate with our systems and tell the systems to perform computation in the kernel. 

We covered Vim as well and Vim is a language that we use to edit txt file. Vim can help us to write txt file efficiently. 

Finally, we learnt how to use PyCharm to develop a tree algorithm. Python is a powerful and more advanced language that many algorithms and data structures can be implemented by it.
